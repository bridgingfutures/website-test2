New analysis of the Office for National Statistics follow-up survey for visa holders entering the UK under the Ukraine Humanitarian Schemes shows a relatively high share of respondents who were in work and a strong intention to remain and settle long-term in the UK. The survey finds that many visa holders are working or actively looking for jobs and report plans to stay in the country, which points to a rapid labour-market attachment among this group. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

This positive labour-market picture aligns with broader OECD analysis that highlights recent developments in immigrant labour-market inclusion in the United Kingdom, where labour-market outcomes for many recent arrivals place the UK among the better performing OECD countries for integration into work (UK is cited among the top performers in several OECD comparisons). These findings suggest that policies and local labour demand have enabled relatively fast entry into employment for many of the humanitarian visa holders. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
