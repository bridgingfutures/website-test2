New data from the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) paints a clear picture: Ukrainians who arrived under humanitarian schemes are not just passing through—they are actively building their lives here.

A striking **69% of adults** on the Ukraine schemes are now in work, according to the latest ONS survey. More tellingly, when asked about their future, **68%** said they intend to live in the UK long-term, even if it becomes safe to return to Ukraine. Only 15% plan to return permanently.

This isn't just a UK phenomenon. The UK ranks in the **top 3 countries** globally for the speed at which Ukrainian refugees find employment, as highlighted in the OECD's *International Migration Outlook 2025*.

The narrative is shifting from short-term refuge to long-term integration. People are working, paying taxes, and putting down roots. The question is no longer whether Ukrainians are settling in, but how the system will recognise this reality.
