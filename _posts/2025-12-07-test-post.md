## 1. Introduction

This is a **test post** for the Bridging Futures website.  
It exists purely to show how different types of content will look in the theme:

- Headings and paragraphs  
- Emphasis and inline formatting  
- Lists (ordered and unordered)  
- Code blocks  
- Tables  
- Images (including the preview image from front matter)  
- Embedded YouTube video

You can safely edit, break, or delete this post without affecting anything else.

## 2. Headings & paragraphs

### 2.1. Second-level heading

This is a regular paragraph of body text. It should be easy to read and have
comfortable line spacing.

#### 2.1.1. Third-level heading

Another paragraph follows here, just to check spacing between paragraphs and
headings. Temporary protection is often described as *“short-term”*, even when
it risks becoming **permanent temporariness**.[^1]

##### 2.1.1.1. Fourth-level heading

Fourth-level headings are useful for very detailed documents or appendices.

## 3. Inline emphasis & quotes

You can use different inline styles:

- **Bold** text for key points  
- _Italic_ text for light emphasis  
- `inline code` for short snippets  
- ~~Strikethrough~~ when something is no longer valid

> This is a short blockquote.
>
> It can span multiple lines and will usually be styled differently to stand
> out from the main text.

> “This is a slightly longer quote that spans more than one line in order to
> test how wider quotes behave in the layout.”

## 4. Lists

### 4.1. Unordered list

- First point
- Second point
  - Nested point A
  - Nested point B
- Third point

### 4.2. Ordered list

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## 5. Code blocks

### 5.1. Generic fenced code

```bash
# Example: build the site locally
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

```json
{
  "example": true,
  "note": "This is a JSON code block."
}
```

## 6. Tables

### 6.1. Simple comparison table

| Year | Scheme / route                         | Type of status            | Counts towards ILR? |
|------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| 2022 | Ukraine Family Scheme                  | Temporary protection      | No                  |
| 2022 | Homes for Ukraine                      | Temporary protection      | No                  |
| 2023 | Typical Skilled Worker                 | Work route                | Yes                 |
| 2025 | Hypothetical “earned settlement” route | Transitional / potential  | Maybe (TBC)         |

Tables are useful for showing timelines, comparisons, or scenarios.

## 7. Images

### 7.1. Preview image via `image:` in front matter

The preview / OG image for the post is defined at the top of this file in the
front matter. That image is used:

- As the Open Graph / social preview image  
- On the blog index / card preview (depending on the theme configuration)

For reference, the front-matter block looks like this:

```yaml
image:
  path: /assets/img/posts/2025-12-07-temporary-protection-permanent-temporariness.png
  alt: "Preview image used for the Bridging Futures formatting test post"
```

And here is the **same image** inserted directly into the post content:

![Preview image used for the Bridging Futures formatting test post](/assets/img/posts/2025-12-07-temporary-protection-permanent-temporariness.png)

### 7.2. Inline image with caption text

You can also add a short caption right under the image as plain text:

*Figure 1: Example preview image used in Bridging Futures test post.*

## 8. Embedding video

### 8.1. YouTube

Below is an embedded YouTube video using the Chirpy include.  
You only need to specify the video ID (the part after `watch?v=` in the URL).

Original URL:

`https://youtu.be/oXPqkP0Mz58`

Embedded via Jekyll include:

{% include embed/youtube.html id="oXPqkP0Mz58" %}

The player above should appear directly inside the post.

for many years without a clear path to settlement.
