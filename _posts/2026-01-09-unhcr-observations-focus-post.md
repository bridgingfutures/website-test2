UNHCR has published detailed observations on the UK Government’s *Restoring Order and Control* statement on asylum and returns. The document is unusually direct about the risks of redesigning protection around **short, renewable grants of stay** paired with **delayed or harder settlement**.

Read the full observations:

UNHCR’s core message is that a protection system built on repeated review and long waits for settlement can:
- create prolonged uncertainty (with serious mental health and social costs),
- weaken incentives and capacity to integrate (work, training, stable housing),
- increase administrative churn and casework over time,
- and ultimately make returns and compliance harder rather than easier.

In other words: when “temporary” lasts for years, it stops functioning as a bridge and becomes a **structural limbo**.

Unfortunately the same “long temporary” problem already exists outside the asylum system. Ukrainians on the UK’s Ukraine schemes can work and rebuild their lives here, but still have **no defined settlement endpoint** — and time on **Appendix Ukraine Scheme** is excluded from the 10-year Long Residence route, grouped with clearly short-term categories. This means that, in settlement terms, many Ukrainians are already in a position that is at least as insecure as the model UNHCR warns against.
