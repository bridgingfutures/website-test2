Many Ukrainians in the UK are working, paying taxes, and building lives — yet remain on time-limited leave with no dedicated route to settlement.

Other countries have already started building **“earned stability”** mechanisms: if people are **economically self-sufficient and integrated**, they can access **longer residence** — and in some cases **time under temporary protection starts counting** (fully or partially) toward permanent status.

Below are a few clear, well-documented examples.

## Selected international precedents (with primary sources)

### Austria (Vienna): a work-based route and time that can count
Vienna’s guidance explains a **Red-White-Red Card plus for displaced persons from Ukraine**, with eligibility linked to having an ID card for displaced persons and **having been gainfully employed / insured** (a work-and-contributions framing).  
If the holder has lived in Austria for **at least five years**, they can apply for **Permanent Residence – EU**, and the page explicitly says that the **time with the displaced-person ID card is included**.

Austria also publicly clarifies broad labour market access for displaced people who hold the relevant ID card.

### Czech Republic: a “special long-term residence” + partial counting to permanent residence
Czechia introduced a **special long-term residence** concept for **economically self-sufficient** holders of temporary protection (Lex Ukrajina VII framing).  
Read: [Czech Ministry of Interior – Lex Ukrajina 7](https://mv.gov.cz/clanek/vlada-schvalila-lex-ukrajina-7-ekonomicky-sobestacni-uprchlici-z-ukrajiny-budou-moci-ziskat-dlouhodoby-pobyt.aspx)  
Practical portal: [IPC – Zvláštní dlouhodobý pobyt](https://ipc.gov.cz/zvlastni-dlouhodoby-pobyt/)

Crucially, the Czech legal text states that **for the purposes of permanent residence**, the **time spent on temporary protection counts as half** (i.e., it is not “wasted time”).  
Legal text: [Parliament document (t0727a0.pdf)](https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=243031)

And as an additional pro-employment signal, Czech law treats holders of temporary protection (and the related long-term permit) **as if they had permanent residence for the purposes of employment law**.  
Same legal text: [Parliament document (t0727a0.pdf)](https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=243031)

### Poland: a new 3-year temporary residence permission (longer horizon)
Poland’s 2025 legal changes introduce a **temporary residence permission valid for 3 years** for eligible Ukrainians under the special act framework.  
Legal publication: [Dziennik Ustaw (2025 poz. 337)](https://dziennikustaw.gov.pl/DU/2025/337)  
Legislative/explanatory materials: [Senat / Sejm print (342)](https://www.senat.gov.pl/download/gfx/senat/pl/senatposiedzeniatematy/5700/drukisejmowe/342.pdf)

Even where the route is still “temporary”, the **time horizon** matters: a multi-year permission can reduce the churn of renewals and makes it easier for people and employers to plan.

### Germany: counting §24 residence time (citizenship context) + stability guidance
German guidance notes that time spent with a residence permit under **§24 AufenthG** can be **counted as lawful residence** in the context of later acquiring German citizenship (subject to meeting the conditions).

Germany has also issued official clarifications on practical implementation and switching/transition issues around §24 status.

### Australia: a permanent-visa option for eligible Ukrainians (Resolution of Status)
Australia has a documented pathway for eligible Ukrainians via a **permanent visa (Resolution of Status, Subclass 851)**.  
Briefing: [Refugee Advice & Casework Service (RAILS) – Subclass 851 (PDF)](https://www.rails.org.au/sites/default/files/2024-10/24.10.16%20Subclass%20851%20Ukrainians.pdf)

### Canada: public calls for a PR pathway (policy pressure)
In Canada, Ukrainian community organisations and policymakers are openly calling for a **pathway to permanent residency** for displaced Ukrainians (e.g., for CUAET holders and families).  
Read: [UCC – Dec 17, 2025 statement](https://www.ucc.ca/2025/12/17/ucc-joins-senator-kutcher-calling-on-government-to-provide-pathway-to-permanent-residency-for-displaced-ukrainians/)

## Employment: a quick comparison to the UK (why “earned stability” is coherent)

In the UK, available survey evidence suggests Ukrainians are already contributing economically — but **legal temporariness remains unchanged**.
For example, the University of Birmingham survey snapshot we previously covered found a high share of respondents economically active — with many working below their qualification level.  
(Our summary post: [UoB survey – displaced Ukrainians](./2025-11-18-uob-survey-displaced-ukrainians.html))

By contrast, the examples above explicitly connect **work/integration** with **longer status**:
- **Austria** ties eligibility to **insured employment / gainful activity**, and explicitly includes time with the displaced-person ID when assessing the 5-year residence period for Permanent Residence – EU.
- **Czechia** builds a “special long-term residence” specifically for the **economically self-sufficient** and even treats temporary protection holders as permanent residents **for employment law purposes** — while also letting temporary-protection time count (partially) toward permanent residence.
- **Poland** creates a longer (3-year) residence horizon for eligible people, easing repeat renewals.
- **Australia** demonstrates that a permanent status option can exist for eligible cohorts.
- **Canada** shows active mainstream policy debate about a PR pathway (even when not yet enacted).

## Why this matters for the UK
These precedents show a practical policy idea that keeps coming up across countries:

> If people are working, paying taxes, and integrating, **temporary protection should not trap them in permanent temporariness**.

A UK approach could mirror the most “administratively realistic” parts of these models:
- a defined **earned route** for economically self-sufficient Ukrainians, and/or
- a rule that **time already spent** on Ukraine schemes **counts** (fully or partially) toward settlement.
