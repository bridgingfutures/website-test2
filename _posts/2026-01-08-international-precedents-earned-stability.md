Many Ukrainians in the UK are working, paying taxes, and building lives — yet remain on time-limited leave with no dedicated route to settlement.

Other countries have already started building **“earned stability”** mechanisms: if people are **economically self-sufficient and integrated**, they can access **longer residence** — and in some cases **time under temporary protection starts counting** (fully or partially) toward permanent status.

Below are a few clear, well-documented examples.

## Selected international precedents (with primary sources)

### Austria (Vienna): a work-based route and time that can count
Vienna’s guidance explains a **Red-White-Red Card plus for displaced persons from Ukraine**, with eligibility linked to having an ID card for displaced persons and **having been gainfully employed / insured** (a work-and-contributions framing).  
If the holder has lived in Austria for **at least five years**, they can apply for **Permanent Residence – EU**, and the page explicitly says that the **time with the displaced-person ID card is included**.

Austria also publicly clarifies broad labour market access for displaced people who hold the relevant ID card.

### Czech Republic: a “special long-term residence” + partial counting to permanent residence
Czechia introduced a **special long-term residence** concept for **economically self-sufficient** holders of temporary protection (Lex Ukrajina VII framing).  
Read: [Czech Ministry of Interior – Lex Ukrajina 7](https://mv.gov.cz/clanek/vlada-schvalila-lex-ukrajina-7-ekonomicky-sobestacni-uprchlici-z-ukrajiny-budou-moci-ziskat-dlouhodoby-pobyt.aspx)  
Practical portal: [IPC – Zvláštní dlouhodobý pobyt](https://ipc.gov.cz/zvlastni-dlouhodoby-pobyt/)

Crucially, the Czech legal text states that **for the purposes of permanent residence**, the **time spent on temporary protection counts as half** (i.e., it is not “wasted time”).  
Legal text: [Parliament document (t0727a0.pdf)](https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=243031)

And as an additional pro-employment signal, Czech law treats holders of temporary protection (and the related long-term permit) **as if they had permanent residence for the purposes of employment law**.  
Same legal text: [Parliament document (t0727a0.pdf)](https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=243031)

### Poland: a new 3-year temporary residence permission (longer horizon)
Poland’s 2025 legal changes introduce a **temporary residence permission valid for 3 years** for eligible Ukrainians under the special act framework.  
Legal publication: [Dziennik Ustaw (2025 poz. 337)](https://dziennikustaw.gov.pl/DU/2025/337)  
Legislative/explanatory materials: [Senat / Sejm print (342)](https://www.senat.gov.pl/download/gfx/senat/pl/senatposiedzeniatematy/5700/drukisejmowe/342.pdf)

Even where the route is still “temporary”, the **time horizon** matters: a multi-year permission can reduce the churn of renewals and makes it easier for people and employers to plan.

### Germany: counting §24 residence time (citizenship context) + stability guidance
German guidance notes that time spent with a residence permit under **§24 AufenthG** can be **counted as lawful residence** in the context of later acquiring German citizenship (subject to meeting the conditions).

Germany has also issued official clarifications on practical implementation and switching/transition issues around §24 status.

### Australia: a permanent-visa option for eligible Ukrainians (Resolution of Status)
Australia has a documented pathway for eligible Ukrainians via a **permanent visa (Resolution of Status, Subclass 851)**.

### Canada: public calls for a PR pathway (policy pressure)
In Canada, Ukrainian community organisations and policymakers are openly calling for a **pathway to permanent residency** for displaced Ukrainians (e.g., for CUAET holders and families).  
Read: [UCC – Dec 17, 2025 statement](https://www.ucc.ca/2025/12/17/ucc-joins-senator-kutcher-calling-on-government-to-provide-pathway-to-permanent-residency-for-displaced-ukrainians/)

## Employment: the UK is top-3 for jobs — but still “temporary”

OECD data shows that Ukrainians’ labour market participation is already high in multiple countries.  
On **page 64** of the OECD *International Migration Outlook 2025*, the report notes:

> “Several countries now report high levels of labour market participation. In 2024, **Poland (78%)**, **Lithuania (72%)** and the **United Kingdom (69%)** recorded the highest employment rates, while **Czechia, Denmark, Estonia and the Netherlands** also reported rates close to or exceeding **60%**.”

(PDF edition: <a href="https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/publications/reports/2025/11/international-migration-outlook-2025_355ae9fd/ae26c893-en.pdf">download</a>)

This is the key point for the UK debate: **the UK is already in the top three by Ukrainian employment rate** — i.e., integration through work is happening — yet the legal status remains **time-limited** under the Ukraine schemes.

By contrast, several countries **with employment rates below the UK’s 69%** (or around 60%+) still provide clearer “earned stability” bridges:

- **Austria** links the **RWR Card Plus** route to work/self-sufficiency, and explicitly includes time spent with the displaced-person ID when assessing the 5-year residence period for **Permanent Residence – EU**.  
  <a href="https://www.wien.gv.at/english/e-government/documents/residence/thirdcountries/rwr-card-plus-ukraine.html">Stadt Wien – RWR Card Plus (Ukraine)</a>

- **Czechia** created a **special long-term residence** option for the economically self-sufficient and also lets time on temporary protection count **partially (50%)** toward permanent residence.

  <a href="https://www.psp.cz/sqw/text/orig2.sqw?idd=243031">Parliament text (t0727a0)</a>

- **Poland** introduced a longer (3-year) residence horizon for eligible Ukrainians, reducing the churn of short renewals.

- **Australia** shows that a permanent status option can exist for eligible cohorts (Subclass 851).

- **Canada** demonstrates mainstream policy debate about a PR pathway (even if not yet enacted).  
  <a href="https://www.ucc.ca/2025/12/17/ucc-joins-senator-kutcher-calling-on-government-to-provide-pathway-to-permanent-residency-for-displaced-ukrainians/">UCC – Dec 17, 2025 statement</a>

For UK-specific context on “employment vs under-employment”, see our earlier survey summary:  
<a href="./2025-11-18-uob-survey-displaced-ukrainians.html">UoB survey – displaced Ukrainians</a>

**Why this matters:** these examples show a consistent policy logic across countries:  
if people are working, paying taxes and integrating, temporary protection should not become **permanent temporariness**.
