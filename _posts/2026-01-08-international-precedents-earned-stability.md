Many Ukrainians in the UK are working, paying taxes, and building lives — yet remain on time-limited permission with no dedicated route to settlement.

Other countries have already started building **“earned stability”** mechanisms: if people are **economically self-sufficient and integrated**, they can access **longer residence** — and in some cases **time under temporary protection starts counting** (fully or partially) toward a durable status.

Below are a few clear, well-documented examples.

### Austria: a work-based route and time that can count
Vienna’s guidance explains a **Red-White-Red Card plus for displaced persons from Ukraine**, with eligibility linked to holding a displaced-person ID and **having been gainfully employed / insured** (a work-and-contributions framing). It also states that after **five years**, the calculation for **“Permanent Residence – EU”** can **include time spent with the displaced-person ID card**.

### Czech Republic: a “special long-term residence” + partial counting
Czechia introduced a **special long-term residence** option (Lex Ukrajina 7) aimed at **economically self-sufficient** holders of temporary protection, issued for **5 years**. It also explicitly provides that for permanent residence purposes, time on temporary protection counts **at 50%** (it counts, but only half).

### Poland: a longer (3-year) residence horizon — and time that counts toward long-term residence
Poland’s legal changes introduce a **temporary residence card valid for 3 years (CUKR)** for eligible Ukrainians under the special act framework, reducing the churn of short renewals. Importantly, Poland’s official guidance explicitly states that **time spent in Poland on the basis of the CUKR residence card will be counted** toward the period required to obtain an **EU long-term resident permit**.

### Germany: counting §24 residence time (citizenship context) + stability guidance
Guidance notes that residence under **§24 AufenthG** can be treated as **lawful residence time** in the context of later acquiring German citizenship (subject to conditions), and provides practical clarification around switching/transition questions.

### Australia: a permanent-visa option for eligible Ukrainians (Resolution of Status)
Australia has a documented pathway for eligible Ukrainians via a **permanent visa (Resolution of Status, Subclass 851)**.

### Canada: pressure for a PR pathway (policy debate)
In Canada, Ukrainian community organisations and policymakers have publicly called for a **pathway to permanent residency** for displaced Ukrainians.

### New Zealand: a residence-class visa (not time-limited protection) + clear route to PR and citizenship
New Zealand created a Ukraine Resident Visa for eligible Ukrainians already in the country under the 2022 Special Ukraine Visa framework. This is a residence-class visa (not a temporary protection extension), and Immigration NZ states that after 2 years on this visa, holders can apply for a Permanent Resident Visa. With residence status, people can also move toward citizenship via New Zealand’s standard presence requirements.

## Employment: the UK is in the top three for Ukrainian employment rates
OECD data shows high labour-market participation by displaced Ukrainians across multiple host countries. On **page 64** of the OECD *International Migration Outlook 2025*, the report notes that in 2024 **Poland (78%)**, **Lithuania (72%)** and the **United Kingdom (69%)** recorded the highest employment rates, while **Czechia, Denmark, Estonia and the Netherlands** also reported rates close to or exceeding **60%**.

By contrast, even where employment rates are below the UK’s 69%, governments have still put clearer “earned stability” bridges on the table — linking longer status to work/self-sufficiency, allowing time under temporary protection to count (fully or partially), extending residence horizons to multiple years, or openly debating a PR pathway.

## Why this matters for the UK
Looking across international approaches, the practical question is consistent: what happens when “temporary” protection lasts for years and people build lives in the host country? In the UK context, this is especially visible because time on Ukraine schemes is currently treated for long-residence purposes alongside short-term routes like **Visitor, Short-term Student (English language) and Seasonal Worker** — even though, in everyday reality, Ukraine permission enables the kinds of work-and-life participation more commonly associated with **longer-term routes** that do lead somewhere. Many systems respond to this “long temporary” reality with some form of earned stability — clear criteria, a predictable timeline, and a durable endpoint (long-term residence or permanent status). In that spirit, it would be logical for the UK to consider counting time spent on Ukraine schemes toward long residence, or/and offering a dedicated, contribution-based ILR route for those who meet transparent requirements.

Note: any “earned” route should be complemented by separate provisions for disabled people, carers, older people and other vulnerable groups, for whom labour-market thresholds are not an appropriate test of integration.
