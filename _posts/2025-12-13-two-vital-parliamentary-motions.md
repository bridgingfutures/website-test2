The UK Parliament continues its efforts to support Ukrainian refugees. MPs from various parties are tabling **Early Day Motions (EDMs)**. These are formal proposals that draw attention to specific issues and demonstrate the level of parliamentary support for a particular cause.

While EDMs are rarely debated directly, they are a crucial tool for shaping public and political discourse, putting pressure on the government, and showing solidarity.

Today, we highlight **two key EDMs** aimed at addressing the challenges faced by the Ukrainian community in the UK.

## 1. EDM #1000: Support for Ukrainian Refugees and Their Hosts

Tabled on **24 March 2025**, this motion calls on the government to extend and improve support for both Ukrainian refugees and the British families who have opened their homes to them. MPs acknowledge the invaluable contribution of host households under the "Homes for Ukraine" scheme and emphasise the need for long-term stability for those forced to flee their homeland.

*   **Primary Sponsor:** **Pippa Heylings MP**
*   **Key Themes:** Support for the "Homes for Ukraine" scheme, financial aid for hosts, long-term solutions for refugees.
*   **Current Number of Signatures (as of 13.12.2025):** **121** MPs.

**We thank the sponsors of this motion** for recognising the importance of both humanitarian assistance for Ukrainians and sustained support for the generous British hosts who welcomed them.

## 2. EDM #2191: Ukrainian Permission Extension Scheme

This more recent and critically important motion was tabled on **3 November 2025**. It addresses the imminent issue facing hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians whose permission to stay in the UK will soon begin to expire. The EDM urges the government to promptly announce a **simple, automatic, and free visa extension scheme** for all Ukrainians who arrived under the special schemes. This is essential to prevent a crisis of uncertainty and to allow people to plan their futures.

*   **Primary Sponsor:** **Wendy Chamberlain MP**
*   **Key Themes:** Visa extensions for Ukrainians, an automatic and free mechanism, ensuring stability.
*   **Current Number of Signatures (as of 13.12.2025):** **36** MPs.

**We express our gratitude to the authors of this proposal** for raising this most pressing issue for the Ukrainian community in a timely manner and for seeking a practical solution to the upcoming administrative challenge.

## Your Voice Matters!

The more MPs who sign these EDMs, the stronger the signal to the government about the importance of these issues. It is particularly crucial to increase support for the second motion (EDM #2191) on visa extensions.

**We call on all Ukrainians and our friends across the UK:**

**Write to your local MP** and politely ask them to **sign both of these Early Day Motions (No. 1000 and No. 2191)**. It takes just a few minutes but could make a decisive difference.

**Unsure how to contact your MP or what to write?** Get in touch with us! We can help draft a letter and provide you with a detailed guide on how to find your MP and contact them effectively.
