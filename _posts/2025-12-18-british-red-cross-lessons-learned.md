A new British Red Cross report, *Planning for tomorrow: lessons learned from the UK’s response to displacement from Ukraine* (Dec 2025), reviews the UK’s visa-led response since 2022 and what it has meant in practice for safety, welcome and longer-term integration. The report notes that the schemes have enabled **more than 225,000** people to find safety, and presents findings from a nationwide survey of displaced Ukrainians (with the “stay long term” question based on **1,392** respondents currently living in the UK). A clear headline is that **82%** say they would like to stay in the UK long term (**5+ years**) — and **over 91%** want to remain for at least another two years — highlighting how quickly “temporary” protection has become a long-term reality for many families.

The report also sets out four priorities for policy change: a future-ready **Displacement Response Framework** (including adoption of the British Red Cross “Roadmap to Safety, Protection and Belonging”), **secure long-term pathways** for Ukrainians and others to provide stability and real choice, **uphold family unity**, and a **national strategy** that better coordinates and sustainably funds integration support (including English language learning and employment support). Alongside these priorities, the report captures how uncertainty around short-term leave affects everyday decisions — especially around housing, work, education and healthcare — and notes that many respondents want clearer guidance on what comes in future.
