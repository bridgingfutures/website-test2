A new **British Red Cross / Neighbourly Lab / Opora** report, *Planning for tomorrow* (Dec 2025), reviews the UK’s visa-led response to displacement from Ukraine. It notes that **225,000+** people have found safety through the Ukraine schemes, and draws on a survey of **1,421** displaced Ukrainians—of whom **82%** say they hope to remain in the UK long term (five years or more). The report highlights a recurring barrier: **short-term leave and uncertainty** restrict access to stable housing and employment, and make future planning difficult.

The report sets out four priorities for policy change, including: **securing long-term pathways** for Ukrainians and other displaced people, **upholding family unity**, and a **national strategy** that better coordinates and funds integration support (including English language learning and employment support). Recommendations and the full “Roadmap to Safety, Protection and Belonging” are published by the British Red Cross here: https://www.redcross.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/we-speak-up-for-change/ukraine-lessons-learned-report#our-recommendations
