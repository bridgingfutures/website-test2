The UK Parliament continues its efforts to support Ukrainian refugees. MPs from various parties are tabling **Early Day Motions (EDMs)** — motions submitted for debate in the House of Commons **for which no day has been fixed**.

As there is no specific time allocated to EDMs, **very few are debated**. However, they are widely used to put views on the record, draw attention to an issue, and demonstrate the level of parliamentary support.

Today, we highlight **two key EDMs** focused on the most urgent need for Ukrainians in the UK: **certainty of status**, including **automatic visa extensions** and a **clear route to settlement**.

## 1) EDM #1000: Ensuring stability for Ukrainian refugees in the UK

Tabled on **24 March 2025**, this motion highlights the real-life impact of uncertainty around visa extensions — including risks of losing **homes and jobs** — and calls on the Government to provide certainty by **automatically extending visas** and setting out a **pathway to Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR)**. It also notes how certainty would help young people **complete their education in the UK**.

* **Primary Sponsor:** **Pippa Heylings MP**
* **Key Themes:** Automatic visa extensions; ILR pathway; stability for housing and employment; enabling young Ukrainians to complete education.
* **Current Number of Signatures (as of 16 December 2025):** **121** MPs. 

This is currently the most-signed EDM tabled since December 2022 ([Parliament EDM search](https://edm.parliament.uk/?Term=&TabledFrom=16%2F12%2F2022&TabledTo=16%2F12%2F2025&IncludeSponsoredByMember=false&IsPrayer=false&IncludeWithdrawn=false&OrderBy=SignatureCountDesc&ShowAdvanced=true)).

## 2) EDM #2191: Ukrainian Permission Extension Scheme

This motion was tabled on **3 November 2025**. It expresses concern about the continuing uncertainty faced by Ukrainians under the Ukraine Schemes and notes that, while the **Ukrainian Permission Extension Scheme** introduced in **February 2025** provided an additional **18 months’ leave to remain**, it does not offer the long-term stability families need.

The EDM calls on the Government to take decisive action by **extending visas automatically** and creating a **route to settlement** for Ukrainians who have made the UK their home.

* **Primary Sponsor:** **Wendy Chamberlain MP**
* **Key Themes:** Automatic visa extensions; route to settlement (ILR); recognising integration and contribution; addressing uncertainty; noting limits of the 18-month UPE scheme.
* **Current Number of Signatures (as of 16 December 2025):** **40** MPs.

We express our gratitude to the authors and supporters of this motions for raising the need for certainty — and a route to settlement — in a clear, practical way.
