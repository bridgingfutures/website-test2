Recent data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) paint a clear picture: Ukrainians in the UK are economically active, integrated into the labour market, and overwhelmingly want to stay — yet their visa status remains stuck at "temporary" with no route to settlement.

According to the ONS survey conducted in April 2024, around **69% of adults on the Ukraine schemes were working**. In a scenario where it is safe to return to Ukraine, approximately **68% of adults said they intend to live in the UK most of the time**, while only **15% said they would live in Ukraine most of the time**.

More recent research from the University of Birmingham (2025) found that over **76% of respondents are economically active**, with **56% working more than 30 hours per week**. Crucially, **72% say they would like to stay in the UK** even if it were safe to return, and only **5% say they would want to return**.

## Among the highest employment rates in the OECD

The OECD's *International Migration Outlook 2024* shows that the UK's 69% employment rate for Ukrainians places it **third among OECD countries** — behind only Poland (78%) and Lithuania (72%), and ahead of Sweden (66%), the Czech Republic (63%), and Denmark (62%). This is a remarkable achievement, especially when compared to countries like Germany (31%) or Austria and Belgium (under 25%).

In practical terms, this means Ukrainians in the UK are not only working — they are working at rates that exceed many European countries with longer traditions of refugee integration.

## The paradox: high integration, no security

The ONS and OECD data confirm what many Ukrainians in the UK already know from daily experience: they are working, paying tax, renting homes, raising children in British schools, and planning their futures here. Yet their legal status offers no pathway to settlement — not after five years, not after ten, not ever under current rules.

Time spent on the Ukraine schemes does not count towards the 10-year Long Residence route. The schemes themselves are explicitly "not a route to settlement". And under the Government's new asylum framework announced in November 2025, Ukrainians have been left entirely outside the 10-year and 20-year routes to settlement that will apply to others arriving via "safe and legal routes".

The result is a group of residents who, by every practical measure, are integrated and contributing — but who remain in permanent legal limbo.
