During the **Commons exchange on Venezuela** on **5 January 2026**, **Martin Wrigley MP** asked (among other points):

> “…Will the Foreign Secretary confer with her Ukrainian counterparts about giving our Ukrainian guests the option of a right to settle in the UK?”

In a separate exchange on **Ukrainian Refugees** the same day, **Catherine Fookes MP** highlighted the practical impact of insecurity for families building lives in the UK:

> “their temporary status can create practical hurdles, such as in housing or university grant applications, because they may suddenly be uprooted.”

She then asked:

> “What is the Minister doing through the visa system to ensure that refugees from Ukraine have the necessary support and stability to thrive here in the UK in the long term?”

The Minister reiterated the Government’s framing of the Ukraine schemes:

> “We have to be clear that this bespoke route offers temporary sanctuary; it balances the immediate needs of Ukrainians with the future needs of Ukraine as it rebuilds.”

We are grateful to **Martin Wrigley MP** and **Catherine Fookes MP** for raising these two clear points in Parliament.
