On **5 January 2026**, the Commons record captured two familiar themes for Ukrainians in the UK: **stability** and **what comes next**.

During the **Commons exchange on Venezuela**, **Martin Wrigley MP** raised the question directly (among other points):

> “…giving our Ukrainian guests the option of a right to settle in the UK?”

Earlier the same day, in a separate exchange on **Ukrainian Refugees**, **Catherine Fookes MP** described how uncertainty can translate into everyday barriers:

> “their temporary status can create practical hurdles, such as in housing or university grant applications, because they may suddenly be uprooted.”

She then pressed the Minister on the long-term picture:

> “What is the Minister doing through the visa system to ensure that refugees from Ukraine have the necessary support and stability to thrive here in the UK in the long term?”

The Minister restated the Government’s framing of the Ukraine schemes:

> “We have to be clear that this bespoke route offers temporary sanctuary; it balances the immediate needs of Ukrainians with the future needs of Ukraine as it rebuilds.”

We are grateful to **Martin Wrigley MP** and **Catherine Fookes MP** for putting these points on the parliamentary record.
