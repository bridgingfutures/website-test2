During Commons questions on **Venezuela** on **5 January 2026**, **Martin Wrigley MP** asked directly about settlement for Ukrainians in the UK:

> “Will the Foreign Secretary confer with her Ukrainian counterparts about giving our Ukrainian guests the option of a right to settle in the UK?”

Earlier the same day, in a separate exchange on **Ukrainian Refugees**, **Catherine Fookes MP** highlighted how temporary status can create everyday barriers for families building lives here:

> “their temporary status can create practical hurdles, such as in housing or university grant applications, because they may suddenly be uprooted.”

She then asked what is being done “through the visa system” to ensure Ukrainians have “support and stability… in the long term”.

The Minister reiterated the Government’s framing of the Ukraine schemes:

> “We have to be clear that this bespoke route offers temporary sanctuary”

We are grateful to **Martin Wrigley MP** and **Catherine Fookes MP** for putting these questions on the parliamentary record.
