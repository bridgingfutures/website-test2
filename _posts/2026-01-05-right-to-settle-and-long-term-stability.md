During the **Venezuela** statement and questions on **5 January 2026**, **Martin Wrigley MP** asked:

> “Will the Foreign Secretary confer with her Ukrainian counterparts about giving our Ukrainian guests the option of a right to settle in the UK?”

In a separate exchange on **Ukrainian Refugees** the same day, **Catherine Fookes MP** raised the practical harm caused by ongoing insecurity for families building lives in the UK:

> “their temporary status can create practical hurdles, such as in housing or university grant applications, because they may suddenly be uprooted… [and need] support and stability to thrive here in the UK in the long term”

The Minister reiterated the Government’s framing of the Ukraine schemes:

> “We have to be clear that this bespoke route offers temporary sanctuary”

We are grateful to **Martin Wrigley MP** and **Catherine Fookes MP** for raising these two clear points in Parliament.
