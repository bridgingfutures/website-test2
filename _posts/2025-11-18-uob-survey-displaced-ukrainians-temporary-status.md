A new University of Birmingham report on displaced Ukrainians in the UK draws on a nationwide survey of **2,984** respondents and highlights the ongoing cost of visa uncertainty: while **218,600** Ukraine Scheme visa holders have arrived in the UK (with **267,200** visas issued), the schemes still provide **no designated pathway to settlement** and—since **November 2024**—time on these routes **does not count** towards the **10-year Long Route**; despite **76%** being economically active, **67%** report working below their skill level, the reported weekly pay averages **£524.75** (median **£462**) versus an estimated Skilled Worker salary threshold of **~£802/week**, meaning only **8%** of respondents who shared wages would meet that requirement, and looking ahead **72%** say they would like to stay in the UK even if it were safe to return to Ukraine (only **5%** would return).
